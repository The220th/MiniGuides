Q:

I want connections coming in on ppp0 on port 8001 to be routed to 192.168.1.200 on eth0 on port 8080.

I've got these two rules

-A PREROUTING  -p tcp -m tcp --dport 8001 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.1.200:8080

-A FORWARD -m state -p tcp -d 192.168.1.200 --dport 8080 --state NEW,ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT

and it doesn't work. What am I missing?


A:


First of all - you should check if forwarding is allowed at all:

cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/ppp0/forwarding 
cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/eth0/forwarding 

If both returns 1 it's ok. If not do the following:

echo '1' | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/ppp0/forwarding
echo '1' | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/eth0/forwarding

Second thing - DNAT could be applied on nat table only. So, your rule should be extended by adding table specification as well (-t nat):

iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -i ppp0 --dport 8001 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.1.200:8080
iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp -d 192.168.1.200 --dport 8080 -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT

Both rules are applied only to TCP traffic (if you want to alter UDP as well, you need to provide similar rules but with -p udp option set).

Last, but not least is routing configuration. Type:

ip route

and check if 192.168.1.0/24 is among returned routing entries.
